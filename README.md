# [Historic Gems](https://historicgems-e6d80.web.app/)

The `Historic Gems` is a web application designed to document, explore, and celebrate humanity's most significant historical treasures. This platform provides users with a comprehensive database of artifacts, featuring `detailed` information such as images, names, types, historical contexts, discovery details, and current locations.

The application allows users to `browse artifacts`, `view detailed descriptions`, and `contribute by adding their own entries`. With interactive features `like` a liking system and contribution management, users can engage with the artifacts and `track` their favorites. The platform also fosters a collaborative community of history enthusiasts, enabling the preservation and sharing of knowledge about cultural heritage.

Built with a user-friendly interface, the project ensures accessibility across devices and aims to make history engaging, educational, and interactive for a global audience. This initiative combines technology and history to create a lasting digital repository of humanity's artifacts.
